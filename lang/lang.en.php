Eurokancom is a family company established 30 years ago.The first three decades of their business were marked by very good business decisions, firmly set direction as well as the best quality of work. Our efforts have also been noticed beyond the boarders of Serbia which resulted in a merge with two prestigious Italian furniture manufacturers, the companies:“Livoni” (established in1966.) and “Interior Beltramini” (established in 1892).';

Wood briquette belongs to the group of environmentally friendly pure fuels. It is made from dry wood residue without any chemical treatment or additives. It is produced in hydraulic or mechanical presses, with no additives nor glue, which makes it fulfil highly demanding ecological standards (DIN 51731). Due to its high compressibility, this natural product has the performance similar to that of high calorie coals.';
$lang['EKO_SVEST_TEXT2'] = 'The basic difference appears in the burning process as it emits significantly less sulphur, and the CO2 emission is well balanced because wood briquette emits as much CO2 into the atmosphere as trees do in the process of photosynthesis. This fuel, due to it low water content (less than 10%), releases high energy in the process of burning – from 4.8 to 5.2 kWh/kg, in comparison to the raw wood which releases 2.5 kWh/kg at most. Briquette leaves incomparably less ash. When it comes to practice: Briquette delivery costs are lower, There is no need for preparatory period in heating seasons, It can be used in any type of furnaces for hard fuels.';
